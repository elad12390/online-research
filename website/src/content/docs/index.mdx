## The old way sucks

You need to research something. You open Google. Three hours later: 47 tabs, a messy doc, half-remembered facts, and the growing suspicion you missed something important.

**Research Portal fixes this.** Tell it what you need. Walk away. Come back to structured findings with sources.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Actually works autonomously" icon="rocket">
		Not a chatbot you babysit. Real agents that search, read, cross-reference, and write reports end-to-end.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Your machine, your data" icon="magnifier">
		Self-hosted SearXNG for search. No queries hit Big Tech servers. Everything stays local.
	</Card>
	<Card title="See everything it does" icon="approve-check">
		Watch searches happen, sources get read, decisions get made. Full transparency, zero black box.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Use models you're already paying for" icon="puzzle">
		Claude, GPT-4, Gemini — plug in your API key and go. Switch anytime.

## How it works

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elad12390/online-research.git && cd online-research && ./setup.sh
```

**That's the setup.** Open `localhost:3000`, describe your research topic, hit go.

The agent searches the web, reads what it finds, writes up findings as markdown/HTML, saves everything locally. You browse results in a clean interface whenever you want.

## Built for people who research often

**Developers** comparing tools, frameworks, services before committing.

**Product people** doing competitive analysis, market research, user research synthesis.

**Anyone** tired of the Google → tabs → messy doc → forgot what I read loop.

---

## What you get

**Structured reports** — Not chat transcripts. Actual organized documents with sections, comparisons, sources.

**Plain files** — Markdown and HTML in folders. Git-friendly. Survives if you uninstall the app.

**MCP integration** — Claude Desktop can search your research library. Your past research becomes context for future AI conversations.

**Real-time progress** — Watch it work or check back later. Either way, you'll know exactly where things stand.

## What you don't get

No cloud sync. No team features. No mobile app. No subscription.

This is a power-user tool for people who want research automation without giving up control. If that's you, [get started →](/online-research/getting-started/quick-start/)
