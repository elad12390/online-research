## Why Research Portal?

You need to research something. Maybe it's comparing products, understanding a market, or learning a new technology. The old way: open 47 browser tabs, copy-paste quotes into a doc, lose track of sources, waste half your day.

**The new way:** Tell Research Portal what you need. Come back to a structured report with sources, comparisons, and actionable insights.

## 30 Seconds to Your First Research

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elad12390/online-research.git
cd online-research && ./setup.sh
```

Open `localhost:3000`, enter a topic, hit go. That's it.

## What Can You Research?

**Product comparisons** — "Best espresso machines under $500 for small kitchens"

**Market research** — "AI coding assistant landscape in 2024"

**Technical deep-dives** — "Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm for a 10-person startup"

**Buying decisions** — "Electric cars with best range-to-price ratio"

Anything you'd normally spend hours Googling.

## How It Works

1. **You describe what you need** — Be specific or vague, the agent adapts
2. **Agent searches and reads** — Uses SearXNG to find sources, actually reads them
3. **Agent writes and organizes** — Creates structured markdown/HTML reports
4. **You review and use** — Everything saved locally, browse anytime

No subscription. No cloud lock-in. Your research, your machine.
